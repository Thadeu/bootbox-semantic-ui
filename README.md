# Bootbox para Semantic-UI

Por motivos pessoais em um projeto, precisei usar bootbox, porém o projeto era feito com Semantic-UI, então decidi reescrever o Bootbox para dar suporte ao Semantic-UI.

Para entender como funciona o Bootbox acesse http://bootboxjs.com ou o projeto original do Bootbox http://paynedigital.com/bootbox
